# Pallet SSVM

SSVM pallet is as a runtime library for [Substrate](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/conceptual/runtime/frame).

We add a dependency crate [rust-ssvm](https://github.com/second-state/rust-ssvm) as our ewasm engine and implement the evmc-client necessary host functions with our substrate backend implementation.
